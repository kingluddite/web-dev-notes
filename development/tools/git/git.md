# GIT

## Git add patch
`$ git add . -p`
## Remove last commit
* You added a commit and want to remove it

`$ git reset --soft HEAD~1`

* [more info](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/undo-last-commit/)

## Clear git local cache
* You have to remove them from the staging area

`$ git rm --cached THE_NAME_OF_THE_FILE_HERE`

## How can I remove a file with sensitive date from the entire history of git?
* I accidentally added `.env` with all API key stuff. Help!
* **IMPORTANT FIRST STEP** Make sure to save your local `.env` someone outside of your app (all traces of it will be wiped. You blow it up and then bring this back so you'll just have it locally)

`git filter-branch --force --index-filter \ "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch .env" --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all`

* Now force push the repo:

`$ git push origin --force --all`

Now tell your collaborators to `rebase`

* [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43762338/how-to-remove-file-from-git-history)

## .gitignore dist
* If you see the dist and it is not getting removed with

`dist/` in your `.gitignore` then use this line to delete the git cache

`$ git rm -rf --cached dist/`

## Cloning GitHub repo and I get asked for username and password
* To prevent this from every happening do 2 things:

1. Make sure you set up SSH with GitHub
2. Don't clone the https repo, use the SSH repo

HTTPS repos have a URL like this: 

`git@github.com:gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog.git`

SSH repos have a URL like this

`git@github.com:gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog.git`

* Using my example to clone and not get asked for credentials use:

`$ git clone git@github.com:gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog.git`

## How to remove local untracked files from the current Git branch
* To remove directories, run:

`$ git clean -fd`

* To remove ignored files, run:

`$ git clean -fX`

* To remove ignored and non-ignored files, run:

`$ git clean -fx`

## If you have a very large git repo it can take forever to open
* Speed it up magically with:

`$ git config --add oh-my-zsh.hide-dirty 1`

* [resource](https://gist.github.com/msabramo/2355834)

## Remote branches
* If you want to pull your remote branch down from github

```
$ $ git fetch
$ git checkout <branch>
```

## Remove `.next` from repo
* I accidentally added `.next` folder to git and since these are generated files, I want to remove them
* In the React folder (client): 
  - Add `.gitignore`
  - Add `.next` as a line inside the file (it should also have `node_modules`)
* Then you need to remove the tracking of `.next` and you do that with this nifty command

`$ git rm -r --cached .next`

## Bulk delete github repos
* Nice to keep it clean and get rid of junk
* [link to repo](https://github.com/kingluddite/bulk-clean-repos)

## Get rid of all changes in branch
* I messed up and want to start again
  - `$ git checkout -f` (you delete and they are gone forever)
  - `$ git reset --hard HEAD^`
  - `$ git clean -n` will tell you what will be deleted (unstaged)
  - `$ git clean -f` Makes the branch like brand new

## How to add upstream to git
Specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with the fork.

`$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git`

## How to pull down a remote branch from Github
When you git clone a repo with multiple branches you will not see all those branches, only the master. But if you use:

`$ git branch -a`

You will see all the remote branches.

Let's say one remote branch looks like this:

`remotes/origin/pages`

[this link discusses this at length](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67699/how-to-clone-all-remote-branches-in-git/72156#72156)

* Basically you don't get all your branches pulled down as you would expect. Instead you can view them all after using `$ git branch -a`. Then just type `$ git checkout someotherbranch` and that remote branch will now exist in a local branch named `someotherbranch` (assuming when you typed `$ git branch -a` the branch name was listed as `remotes/origin/someotherbranch`)

Then do this:

`$ git checkout -b pages origin/pages`

Then if you look inside using the terminal with `$ ls`, you should see all the files that were inside that branch.

## How to clone a repo without the folder itself
`$ git clone git@github:me/name.git .`

If the folder is not empty

```
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:me/name.git
git pull origin master
```

* remove .git after you're done and any files you don't want like the README

[source for cloning without folder](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6224626/github-clone-contents-of-a-repo-without-folder-itself)

remote
/var/repo/thm.com.git
cd in /var/repo/thm.com.git
apt-get install git
git init --bare
ls (you will see a bunch of folder git created)
will create a repo but it won't contain any source code pushed to it
just the different versions each of the times you push to it
all of our actual remote site files are in /srv/www
cd hooks
vi post-receive
* location of where we want to deploy our code
* inside the vim file you will add the following

```
#!/bin/sh
git --work-tree=/var/www/thehollywoodmoguls.com --git-dir=/var/repo/thehollywoodmoguls.com.git checkout -f
```

`:wq!` - this will write, quit and force your last code which will create the file and save it at the same time

now you need to give it executable permissions

`chmod +x post-receive`

now the post-receive will be able to be executed by the operating system
* we now can push code from our server or any server that has access permissions to access it

now exit out of remote server
[add notes on remote user on DO vs super-user]

[how do I add a subdomain on digital ocean that points to a different folder using node]

`exit`

you are now on your local machine
`git add -A`

`git commit -m 'something super great`

`git remote add live ssh://root@192.241.235.95/var/repo/thehollywoodmoguls.com.git`

`git push live master`

our files will get pushed live to our git and the post-receive hook will fire and move the files to /var/www/thm.com

now if you push a commit you don't like
git log to find sha on local machine (super long unique key)
`e922cd7273ed37bc2574d44803ccaae50acff3a3`

copy and past it
`$ git revert e922cd7273ed37bc2574d44803ccaae50acff3a3`

when we push from git it will push it into the var/www/thehollywoodmoguls.com directory (this should be where you site is on the remote site. if it's not there, create it now)
* every time we push it, it will checkout the last copy into the var/www/thm.com folder

Version Control. You need to know how this works.

## Generate a .gitignore
[gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/)
## Some Useful GIT commands

### Undo last commit
```
$ git reset HEAD~
```

### How do I push all branches to remote?
```
$ git push --all origin
```

### How do I remove a remote origin

```
$ git remote rm origin
```

### How do I add a remote origin?

```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPONAME
```

### How to I grab remote branches?

Let's have a chat about this because it's kind of strange. So you have remote branches on your origin repo. If you use 'git pull' it will pull down that branch but if you type `git branch` you will not see it.

To see all remote branches you use `git branch -a`

With the latest version of git, you can use `git fetch` to grab the remote branches and then you can check into that branch with `git checkout [branch name]`

## How to delete a branch?

```
$ git branch -d {the_local_branch} (use -D instead to force deletion without checking merged status)
```

If you have an older version of git, you'll need to update or use the older syntax.

### Stash
When you want to pull down the latest changes but you are in the middle of working on something. You can temporarily `stash` them with:

```
$ git stash
```

### Stash Pop
And then when you have pull down changes you can get your stashed data back with:

```
$ git stash pop
```

## Initialize git repo locally
When you start a project you create a folder. If you want to starting using git for version control of your project, add the following `init` command while you are inside the root of your folder.

```
$ git init
```

## Remove a git repo
You would think this would be simple. If I see something I should just be able to type `rm` and remove it. For files, it is that simple but for folders you run into problems and that is why the `-rf` flag is important. If you want to delete a folder and everything inside it recursively, use the `-rf` flag like in the example below were you are removing the entire .git folder and all of its version control knowlege of your project. 

```
$ rm -rf .git
```

## Forking vs Cloning a repo
You see a repo you like. Just grab its repo url and clone it to a spot on your computer and you are off and running. But what if you like the project so much you want to work on it and make it better. This is the whole impetus behind the open source movement. That is where forking comes into play. Instead of just cloning it, you fork it and that fork takes a copy of that open source community repo and puts that exact copy (github shows an animation of a photocopy machine making a copy of a book) to your repo. If you look at the Github UI you will see they are telling you this information.

![Github UI shows forked repo](https://i.imgur.com/fsSP24C.png)

When you set up your own Github repo you traditionally refer to that as your remote `origin master`. So when you are working on your own project you will add and commit locally and then push to your remote repo (origin master). But when you fork you also have access to `upstream` repo you forked from.

A good tip is to check your remote connections information and this will show you where your remote origin master is and where your `upstream` is. If you don't see it, you may need to add it depending on what you are doing for your project.

## Grab changes instructors make from forked repo

```
$ git pull remote upstream
```

## What are my push and fetch remote connections?

```
$ git remote -v
```

## Add stuff to local repo

```
$ git add -A
```

## Commit stuff to local repo

```
$ git commit -m 'your commit message'
```

## Using origin master and production master
* This is how you can have a staging and production repos on same project folder

```
$ git push -u production master
$ git push -u origin master
```

## Push local changes to remote

```
$ git push
```

## Remove file from staging

```
$ git reset HEAD config.codekit
```

## Check current status

```
$ git status
```

## Create a branch

```
$ git branch (name of branch) 
```

You then need to checkout of current branch
  and move to new created branch with:

```
  $ git checkout (name of branch)
```

Add + commit changes in that branch
Move back to master ($ git checkout master) 
And merge changes into master

```
$ git merge
```

## Forks
When you want to jump in to the world of open source development you are going to fork someone else's repo. This is in contrast to just simply cloning the repo.

When you fork someone else's repo, you get and exact copy of the repo (think xerox copy machine) but it is added inside your repo. You can take this code and totally do whatever you want with it but if you want to contribute to the open source project you can make pull requests to the other person's repo that you forked. They can accept and add your changes or deny or deny and ask for improvements before adding.

When changes happen to this forked repo by the creators of it, you can pull down the new modifications only if you add `upstream` capability to your report. This is the direct connection to communicate from them to you and you to them.

[Here is the link to add that capability](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)

# Git

## Global config

```
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

## Problems

### Can't Push

If you get this error

![ssh permissions error](https://i.imgur.com/TBXPtvt.png)

I get this every now and then. I usually occurs when I for some reason or another delete or change my SSH keys. The solution is just to make sure github has your SSH key in the settings. If not, login and go to your profile on Github. Go to settings and then click the SSH and GPG button. Go the the terminal and quickly copy your SSH key using this command:

```bash
$ pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_rsa.pub file to your clipboard
```

[link to article](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)

Add a new SSH key. Give it a name.
Paste your copied key into the textarea.
Save.

Try to push again and it should work now.


## Git Aliases
These aliases should be in your `.zshrc`

`.zshrc`

```
# ====================
# Git Aliases
# ====================
alias gs='git status'
alias gap='git add -p'
alias ga='git add '
alias gb='git branch '

```
## Starting a fresh project

If you plan on starting a new project with an existing repo, be sure and clear out that repos git data at the start to create a fresh history:

```
$ rm -rf .git && git init
$ git commit -m "Initialize Repo"
```

## Errors

I get this error a lot. If you see something like this and are wondering what is wrong? It means you forgot to add and commit your first repo commit

Usually get it when I first run `git init` and then try to `hub create` and when I `git push origin master` I get the following error.

![common git repo create error](https://i.imgur.com/8dU3F81.png)

Just add and commit and you should be good to go.

## Rebasing with Git issues
I ran into this issue when I tried to run `$ git rebase --continue` and git was telling me `did I forget to use git add???`

[This article explains why](http://wholemeal.co.nz/blog/2010/06/11/no-changes-did-you-forget-to-use-git-add/) and offers a solution:
`$ git rebase --skip`


remove everything from staging
`$ git reset HEAD -- .`

## List remote branches
[source](http://gitready.com/intermediate/2009/02/13/list-remote-branches.html)
Sometimes you may need to figure out what branches exist on a remote repository so you can pull them down and check them out, merge them into your local branches, etc. If you’re using GitHub or gitweb to host your repository it’s usually easy to determine the branch names, but if you need to get them in general or for scripts it’s not exactly clear.

The easiest way is just to use the git branch commands’ various options. -a shows all local and remote branches, while -r shows only remote branches.
`$ git branch`

* master

`$ git branch -a`

* master
  origin/1-2-stable
  origin/3-0-unstable
  origin/HEAD
  origin/master

`$ git branch -r`

  origin/1-2-stable
  origin/2-0-stable
  origin/2-1-stable
  origin/HEAD
  origin/master

So, once you know the name of the branch it’s quite simple to check them out. If you have color options on it’s also quite easy to tell which branches aren’t pulled down since they’re listed in red.

`$ git remote show origin`

The `ls-remote` command returns the SHA1 hash of the latest commit for that reference, so it is quite easy to parse out and get to the exact commit you need if you’re doing some scripting. The --heads option lists only branch names since the command can list tags too.
If you have any other uses for these commands or an easier way to figure out branches that live on a remote, comment away!

`$ git ls-remote --heads origin`

# How to fetch all remote branches
`$ git fetch --all`


## Push all branches to remote

`$ git push REMOTE --all`

example: if your remote is `origin` than `$ git push origin --all`

## What if a student, and I won't mention any names, wanted to delete all the images in a folder and typed `$ rm -rf * .png`. This would delete all the files in that directory and all directories inside that directory.

How would that student get the files back?
Hopefully, the student is using git because this command (as long as they have not added to staging yet) will bring all the deleted files back.

`$ git checkout .`

## Commit only part of a file in Git

You can do `git add --patch filename.x` (**or -p for short**), and git will begin breaking down your file in what it thinks are sensible "hunks" (portions of the file). You will then be prompted with this question:

Stage this hunk [y,n,q,a,d,/,j,J,g,s,e,?]?

And here the meaning of each option:

* `y` stage this hunk for the next commit
* `n` do not stage this hunk for the next commit
* `q` quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining hunks
* `a` stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
* `d` do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
* `g` select a hunk to go to
* `/` search for a hunk matching the given regex
* `j` leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
* `J` leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
* `k` leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
* `K` leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
* `s` split the current hunk into smaller hunks
* `e` manually edit the current hunk
* `?` print hunk help

If the file is not in the repository yet, do first git add `-N filename.x`. Afterwards you can go on with git add `-p filename.x`.

You can use than: `git diff --staged` afterwards to check that you staged the correct ones `git reset -p` to unstage incorrect hunks `git commit -v` to view your commit while you edit the commit message.

Note this is a far different than the `git format-patch` command, which is entirely different.

## How can you keep an empty folder in git?
Use `.gitkeep`

Add a comment just so people know

`// this is just an empty file so the empty folder will stay in git`

### How do I push all branches?
`$ git push --all`

### How do I push all tags?
`$ git push --tags`

### How do I rename the current branch?
`$ git branch -m <newname>`
