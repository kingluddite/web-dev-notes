# Inspect HTTP responses in Postman
* Three things in response

1. Status
2. Body
3. Headers

## Status
* A successful response starts with `2xx`
* Click status code and you'll get more info about what the status code means
* 4xx means you sent something that the server could not understand
* 5xx is a server problem - not your fault

### You also get the Time it took and the Size of the response
* Tell you the size of Body and Header
* You can use `Pretty` to make a response look better
* Copy the response
* Search the repsonse (eyeglass)
* Images
    - You can Send and Download the image
    - Postman can render the image
    - You can use Preview to see what postman has returned

## Headers
* Key/value
* Hover over `eye` for additional info about the particular header
* You could save response
    - This is good for documenting API
