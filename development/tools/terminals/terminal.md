# Terminal
## ll
`$ ll`

* Just show regular files and not hidden files

## Clear Terminal
`cmd` + `k`

## create folder structure from CLI
`$ mkdir -p src/js/components/{container,presentational}`
## check speed of zsh
```
zmodload zsh/zprof # top of your .zshrc file
# Your .zshrc stuff
zprof # bottom of .zshrc
```

## exclude folders for grep search
`$ grep -R --exclude-dir=node_modules -i "getUsers" .`

Cron job
```
If you want to automatically run this script every once in a while, you can use cron jobs. Here are instructions to run the script every other hour. If you want to change how often it runs, I’d read more about cron jobs on the internet.

In terminal, type:
sudo env EDITOR=nano crontab -e

This will open the crontab file. Add the following to it:
0 */2 * * * rm -rf /private/var/log/asl/*.asl >/dev/null 2>&1

Save the file by pressing Control + X. Then, press y, and then enter.
```

# How to run shell script
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions

```
Here's a link which explains about Changing file permission (and ownership)

If you want to skip these (for now of course), you can create a directory/folder in your user-home directory and work on your C programmes (or others) there.

You can open the terminal (press Ctrl + Alt + T) and cd to the target directory:

cd /path/to/target
To give the file "the_file_name" execute permission (if the file-system allows you with the RW rights):

chmod +x the_file_name
```


## Search with grep but exclude a folder like `node_modules`
* Here I search for all logs except in the node_modules directory

`$ grep -R --exclude-dir=node_modules 'console.log(' .`

## Replace spaces in filenames with a dash
`$ find . -type f -name "* *.md" -exec bash -c 'mv "$0" "${0// /_}"' {} \;`

## Replace character in filename with another character
* `brew install rename`
* example: replace `---` with `-`

`$ rename 's/\---/-/g' *.md -vn`

## Search for file names
`$ find . -name 'wp-config-beta-internal.php'`

## Make all foldernames lowercase
```
$ for f in *; do mv "$f" "$f.tmp"; mv "$f.tmp" "`echo $f | tr "[:upper:]" "[:lower:]"`"; done
```

## Search history of grep
`$ history | grep grep`

## How to move all files from current directory to upper directory?
`$ mv * .[^.]* ..`

### Explanation: the `mv` command
* Moves files and directories
* The last argument to `mv` is the target (in this case the directory one step "up" in the tree, ..)
* The arguments before that are the source files and directories
* The asterisk (*) is a wildcard which matches all files which do not start with a dot
* Files that start with a dot (dotfiles) are "hidden"
  - They are matched using the pattern .[^.]*

## !
* One of the most useful shortcuts is using !! to represent the last command you ran
    - example, if you run a command that needs root privileges but forget to add sudo to the beginning, there's no need to retype the command

`$ sudo !!`

* This will run your last used command with root privileges

## Run the last command
* If the command you want to run is a bit further back in your history, you can use the bang in conjunction with the original string to find it
* For example, if you want to run the last command that used cat, you could just type:

`$ !cat`

## See what the last command you ran was

`$ !cat:p`

## Now run that last command

`$ !!`

## run a different command that you ran last, but with the same argument

`$ mkdir /new/awesome/folder`

* To then change into that directory, you could just type:

`$ cd !$`

The `!$` represents the arguments from your last command

## Fix mistakes
* Mistyping the command you want to run
* Say you wanted to run `nano`, but accidentally typed `nanp`:

`$ nanp /path/to/a/document/buried/deep/in/the/filesystem`

* Instead of retyping the whole thing, you could just run:

`^nanp^nano`

## Specific search history
* If you want to see all the recent commands you ran that included `nano`

`$ history | grep nano`

* That will generate a history like:

```
9713  vim vimrc
9714  vim zshrc
9721  vim .tmux/tmux.conf
```

* To run **9721** just `$ !9721`

## Keep commands out of your history
* Just preface them with a space

## Expansions
### `{}`
* easily perform batch operations on multiple versions of a file

#### Say you want to rename just part of a filename
* Instead of typing out 

`$ mv /path/to/file.txt /path/to/file.xml`

* You could just run:

`$ mv /path/to/file.{txt,xml}`

#### Backup up
*  most common example of this is when you're backing up a file that you're making changes to
    - example: if you are tweaking your `rc.conf`, you'll want to make a backup in case the new one doesn't work

`$ sudo cp /etc/rc.conf{,-old}`

* Putting nothing before the comma will just append `-old` to the filename after copying it with `cp`
* If your new file doesn't work out and you want to restore the backed up file to its original location
* Moving the comma to the other end of the brace will remove -old from the end of the file and restore it to its original name

`$ sudo mv /etc/rc.conf{-old,}`

### Create 3 numbered directories
`$ mkdir myfolder{1,2,3}`

## How to Disable the “Last Login” / MOTD on New Terminal Session
* If you don’t want to see that login message or MOTD again, you can get rid of that ‘Last login’ message at the top of a new terminal by entering the following command to create a ‘hushlogin’ file:

`$ touch .hushlogin`

## How to DNS lookup with Mac Terminal
`$ dig ns www.domain.com`

# `curl` command would open Sublime and can't write to body error in terminal
* I had to jump into `.bashrc` `.zshrc` and `.bash_profile`
* I found out that if you type `alias` in the terminal it will list all your alias' in alphabetical order and which file they are in
* Turns out I used a reserved word for an alias which was `bash`
* I need to find and comment out all of them to get curl to work again
* The `curl` command was using the `bash` word in the script

`curl -s https://php-osx.liip.ch/install.sh | bash -s 7.1`

* I was trying to download the latest version of PHP
* And when it got to `bash` in that command, it would open Sublime Text and the bash file
* Here was my alias that caused the problem (I also had the alias in both` .bash_profile` and `.zshrc` so I had to comment them both out)

`alias bash='sublime ~/.bash_profile'`

* I just commented it out and, refreshed with `source ~/.bash_profile` and it worked again
* But I wasted two hours trying to figure this out

##iTerm2
* Add visor

`preferences > keys > Hotkey`

* check Hotkeytoggle a dedicated window with profile
* Choose Hotkey Window from dropdown
* [more info](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/48796/iterm-as-a-slide-out-terminal-from-the-top-of-the-screen)

## Terminal Commands

```
# Move or rename file
## the mv command and rename or move files
## not to add ending `/` or you'll copy just the files inside the directory!
$ cp -R file.js some_folder

# Simple list of files in directory
$ ls
**Important** not to add ending `/` or you'll copy just the files inside the directory!

## How do I move all files that are inside folder A into folder B
$ mv bhs/* ajax-gulp/


## Clear terminal window when it gets too full
$ clear

## Quickly change to `home` directory
$ cd ~
## or just
$ cd

# List all files (hidden and permissions)
## useful if you want to find out if you have read/write permissions on a folder/file
$ ls -la

# Change Directory
# if you just type cd by itself it takes you to the home directory
# ~ is the symbol for home directory
$ cd some-folder

# Make Directory
$ mkdir some-folder

# Make File
$ touch somefile.html

# Move a file
$ mv file.jpg images/kitten.jpg

# Where are you? (Present Working Directory)
$ pwd

# Clear terminal window when it gets too full
$ clear

# Remove file or folder recursively
## if will not be able to remove empty folders if you don't use the -r flag (recursive)
## the -f flag is force
$ rm -rf some-file.js
$ rm -rf some-folder

# grab image from internet and download to your computer
$ curl -O https://some-file.png
# put in images folder
$ curl -O https://some-file.png /images
# rename and download image
$ curl -O new-name.png https://some-file.png

# zip a file
zip -r archive_name.zip folder_to_compress

# unzip (extract) zip
unzip archive_name.zip
```

## Compress files Additional Information

[resource](http://coolestguidesontheplanet.com/how-to-compress-and-uncompress-files-and-folders-in-os-x-lion-10-7-using-terminal/)
### ZIP – Cross Platform

First up is ZIP one of the most commonly used compression techniques used across all platforms

If you want to make a zip without those invisible Mac resource files such as “_MACOSX” or “._Filename” and .ds store files, use the “-X” option in the command so:
```
$ zip -r -X archive_name.zip folder_to_compress
```

### TAR.GZ – Cross Platform

Second up is TAR, an old favourite on Unix/Linux – you add the GZ for the compression – compresses tighter than zip

To compress

```
tar -zcvf archive_name.tar.gz folder_to_compress
```

To extract

```
tar -zxvf archive_name.tar.gz
```

### TAR.BZ2 – Cross Platform

A variation on TAR GZ but with better compression than both tar.gz and zip.

To compress

```
tar -jcvf archive_name.tar.bz2 folder_to_compress
```

To extract

```
tar -jxvf archive_name.tar.bz2
```

### GZ

Without the tar

To extract

```
gunzip archivename.gz
```

# Aliases
## .bash_profile

### Sample .bash_profile

This is your user configuration file.

Moving from one folder to the next can be time consuming and cumbersome. The GUI Finder is what most people use on their Macs but once you get comfortable with the Terminal you will quickly start using Aliases and these will improve your workflow. They are just short keys you time that will take you to a location on your computer you go to a lot. You add these inside your user configuration file which is usually the `.bash_profile`

Alias are great to use for moving quickly around your files. Lots of other stuff you can do too but even if you only use aliases, then you will love the `.bash_profile`

# Coding Environments

## Code Editors
Software for editing code, often extendable.

* Atom
* Sublime Text (Sublime Text Power User - Wes Bos)

# Atom

## Default Atom Features

### Keyboard Shortcuts
* [Flight Manual Link](https://gist.github.com/chrissimpkins/5bf5686bae86b8129bee)
* [link](https://github.com/nwinkler/atom-keyboard-shortcuts)
* [Cheat Sheet Link](https://gist.github.com/chrissimpkins/5bf5686bae86b8129bee)

### Navigation Features
* `opt` + right/left arrow moves to next or previous word
* `cmd` + right/back arrow jumps to beginning or end of line
* `cmd` + up/down arrow goes to top or bottom of document
* `cmd` + `shift` + right/left arrow highlights line from that spot
* `cmd` + `opt` + right/left highlights words at a time
* `ctrl` + `g` (jump to a line number)
* `cmd` + \ (toggle tree view)
* Navigating by symbols (or methods)
    - `cmd` + `r` (then search for what you want to work to in that file)
* Bookmarks (jump to any section of code)
    - `cmd` + `f2` (add a bookmark)
        + to use `f2` to jump to that bookmark or shift f2 to go backwards
    - `ctl` + `f2` (shows all bookmarks so you can easily jump to them)
        + you can set bookmarks all over your project and easily jump to them

### Search Features
* **find and replace**
    - Add the word you want to replace and do it case by case or through all occurences

#### Find in current file or selection
* `cmd` + `f` (simple search by default searches current open page)
    - But if we have a group of code selected we could search 'only in selection option' (`opt` + `cmd` + `s`)
    - But if you are searching through entire doc and you want to do a search for a word where several hits appear, use `cmd` + `g` to toggle through them all

#### Find across project
    - `cmd` + `shift` + `f`
    - you could search a specific file using regex
        + /js/*.js*

#### Find a symbol
    - `cmd` + `r` (find all methods or symbols inside a particular file)

#### Find a file
    - `cmd` + `t` (gives you a list and start typing for fuzzy search so you don't have to take your hands off the keyboard)

#### Snippets and Autocomplete
* Default snippets
    - html + tab (html page)
* You can create your own snippets
* You can add Snippets via packages
* Autocomplete by default
    - Type a word and hit enter and it will type the rest of the word (in dropdown)
    - Autocomplete tells you `f` it is a function

#### Folding
* Collapse / expand blocks of code
    - Hover over and click little down arrow
        + When you do you will see ... at end
            * Line numbers show you that lines are missing because they are collapsed
            * Click again to expand
                + `cmd + ]` opens code chunk
                + `cmd` + `[` collapses code chunk
        + **note** If you are in a large function with lots of nested ifs and other stuff, if you keep using the collapse keyboard shortcuts, it will keep toggling up to the very top level
        + **tip** Collapse the methods that are working and open the one's that are not working, helps you focus better
* Improves navigation and concentration
* Can quickly access via shortcuts

#### Panes
* View multiple files at once
* can split into multiple columns and rows
* panes can contain tabs as well
* click on tabs after opening files and split up/down/left/right
* `cmd` + `shift` + `p` (type Panes) and keep typing to create that pane

# Command Line

## Common Terms
* Operating System (OS)
    - Software that supports the core functionality of a computer, peripherals and applications (i.e. Mac or Android)
* Unix and Linux
    - Unix is an OS (paid) that evolved into Linux (GNU) [for free], which runs on all Macs and many web servers running web sites.
* Disk Operating System (DOS)
    - Group of OS (often meaning MS-DOS for Windows). Windows now supports Linux *
* Application (App)
    - Program designed to perform specific set of related tasks. Runs in an OS.
* Shell
    - User interface for OS or Application.
    - Two types:
        + GUI
        + CLI
* Graphical User Interface (GUI)
    - Allows app or OS interactions using peripherals and a designed interface.
* Command Line Interface (CLI)
    - A text input/out interface or interloper for an OS or an Application
* Bash (Bourne-Again Shell (Bash)
    - The most common shell or CLI for Linux. Default on Macs.
    - There are other Shell options (like Zsh)
* Console
    - Text only application that provide CLI access. (i.e. Terminal, iTerm)
    - **note** when we use the command line we are using a console but what we are typing and interacting with is actually the bash (or shell) that lets us do command line interactions
    - the terms often get lumped together but it is important to know the subtle differences
* The Command Line
    - A generic term for CLI commands used to interact with the OS, apps or small scripts or tools. Often refers to using an app like Terminal

# The Command Prompt
We open our terminal and the first thing we see is the `Command Prompt`

* Displays before command line input
    - Includes:
        + Computer name
        + Username
        + (and maybe much more as this can be configured)
    - Highly Customizable

## The Command Line Syntax
* Commands
* Options
* Parameters

`$ command` (first thing you type is the command)

`$ command --option` (long way to type out options)

`$ command -o` (short way to type out options)

`$ command -oa` (short way and combining options)

`$ command -o parameter` (short way with options and parameters)

If you working with git or some other tool you may see

`$ tool command -o parameter`

## Basic Commands
* pwd - Current directory
* cd - Change directory
    - `$ cd ../` (back out of a folder)
* ls - List items in directory
* touch - Create a file
* mkdir - Create a directory
* cp - Copy files
    - you can copy a folder into another folder and rename it at the same time
        + `$ cp styles.css css/new-style.css`
        + you can do the same thing with the `mv` command
            * it won't duplicate it but it will rename it
* mv - Move files
* rm/rmdir - Deleting
    - `rmdir name-of-directory`

**notes**
* if you folders have spaces then type `$ ls "My Desktop"`
* if you are getting low in the terminal type `ctrl` + `l` (and then you can scroll back up)
    - `ctrl` + `k` clears screen but you can't scroll back up

## Options

ls -l (long form view of your files)
ls -al (it will show all files) (hidden files too and permissions)

## Command Line Tips
* clear screen
* command history
* tab autocomplete
* piping
* open Command
* head and tail commands

clear screen
`ctrl` + `l`
`cltr` + `k` (hard clearing)

`up arrow` shows history

autocomplete
begin name and tab to autocomplete

you can use `\` to escape spaces

## piping

`$ touch README.md | ls`

That will create a file and then list all the files that are now in the pwd

this won't work
`$ cd css | ls`

you need to type it like this

`$ (cd css; ls )`

* the above is using something called `subshells`

# open a folder inside the finder
open . (opens current folder in finder)
you can drag and drop any folder from finder and it will put the full path into the Terminal

`$ atom .` (opens directory into atom)

## Head and Tail

`$ head style.css`

Will show you the first lines of that file

`$ tail style.css`

Shows you the bottom lines of that file

## Wes Bos Command Line
* Using iTerm
* ZSH as a bash alternative
* ZSH Plugins
* Oh My ZSH Themes
* Z shortcuts
    - build up your Z Database (amazing and saves you a ton of time with changing directories), in time z becomes faster than the mouse
* Advanced History
* Use Trash instead of `rm`

## Z
Using this will help you not have to rely solely on aliases
[link to Wes Bos Z tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbNn5zJLZU0)

Practice these more
* iTerm and Coding Environment
* Explore ZSH Themes (Create Your Own)
    - `$ atom ~/.zshrc`

Add `ZSH_THEME="random"`

open a bunch of tabs and you will see different themes
when you find one you like:

`$ print $RANDOM_THEME`
then you can save the theme and rename it and tweak it
comment out a bunch so you can jump back to one if you want

* Switching between bash and zsh
`$ exec bash`
`$ source ~/.bash_profile`

`$ exec zsh`

also you can use (wonky)
`$ chsh -s /bin/bash`
enter your password
restart terminal window

or
`$ chsh -s /bin/zsh`
enter password
restart terminal window

## scp
Transfer files from local to remote and vice versa

The syntax for scp is:

If you are on the computer from which you want to send file to a remote computer:

scp /file/to/send username@remote:/where/to/put
Here the remote can be a FQDN or an IP address.

On the other hand if you are on the computer wanting to receive file from a remote computer:

scp username@remote:/file/to/send /where/to/put
scp can also send files between two remote hosts:

scp username@remote_1:/file/to/send username@remote_2:/where/to/put
So the basic syntax is:

scp username@source:/location/to/file username@destination:/where/to/put
You can read man scp to get more ideas on this.

### example
on local computer and grabbing remote file and placing on desktop

```$ scp myusername@1.2.3.4:/home/myusername/public_html/staging/dev_myusername.com/myusername.sql ~/Desktop
myusername.sql
```

* Look on your desktop and there it shall be. And no FTP needed!

#### Move folder contents into parent folder
* Make sure you are in the root of your project folder
* `$ ls` should show you `SOMECHILDFOLDER`
* Move all the files inside `travel-site-files` to the parent folder `travel-site`

`$ mv travel-site-files/* .`

* If you also want to move hidden files

`$ mv travel-site-files/.* .`

* Remove the empty child folder

`$ rm -rf travel-site-files`
