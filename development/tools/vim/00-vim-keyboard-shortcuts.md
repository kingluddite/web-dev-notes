# VIM
## Select word under cursor
`$ viw` (view inner word)

:windo difft (show diff of open files)

## select content or inclusive content
To select between the single quotes I usually do a vi' ("select inner single quotes").

Inside a parenthesis block, I use vib ("select inner block")

Inside a curly braces block you can use viB ("capital B")

To make the selections "inclusive" (select also the quotes, parenthesis or braces) you can use a instead of i

## Delete to beginning of line
`d0`

## Advanced Navigation
* Flying at Warp Speed

### 6 core topics
1. Various Motions
  * Using the screen and scrolling instead of using j k h l all the time
  ![various motions](https://i.imgur.com/guxV7cl.png)
  * H M L
    - High Middle Low of screen
  * zt, zz, zb (instead of going to the high, middle or low of the screen, this moves the screen such that your cursor is at the high/middle/low of the screen)
  * go up (ctrl up arrow) half a screen
  * go down (ctrl down arrow) half a screen
  * go up a full screen length (ctrl - b)
  * go down a full screen length (ctrl - f)
  * scroll up (ctrl + y)
  * scroll down (ctrl + e)
2. Editing
3. Searches
4. Marks
5. Tags
  * Allow you to jump to the definition of certain key words

quit all
`$ qa!`
## Find and replace in multiple files
* Install
  - fcf
    + `$ brew install fzf`
  - fcfvim
  - riprep
    + `$ brew install ripgrep`

## Find things in a line
* `f` + type letter you are looking for
* `F` same thing as above but in reverse order
* `t` + type letter you are looking for (drops you right in front of that letter)
* `T` same thing as above but in reverse
* If you are at the end of the line in `COMMAND` mode and type `I` you will be brought to the beginning of the line in INSERT mode
* If you are at the beginning of the line in COMMAND mode and type `A` you will be brought the beginning of the line in `INSERT` mode

## Finding things in an entire file
* Type `/` and the word you want, let's use `the`, it will highlight all of those `the` words, hit enter and all the matches will be highlighted
  - Type `n` key to cycle through each of the matches until it gets to the end and if you hit `n` again it will start at the top again and keep cycling through
  - You can use `shift` + `n` and it will cycle through the highlighted words in reverse
  - You can also use `?` to do a search and by default it searches in reverse and if you type `n` you go backwards and `shift` + `n` goes forwards

### replace words globally
`:%s/the/foobar/g`

* Typing the above out is a bit slow and tedious, there is a faster way and that is hover over word and type `shift` + `8` (which is the `*`)
  - You will see the word you are over is in the search bar

### Undo
`u`

### A better way to replace words with keybindings
* I added this in my .vimrc

```
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Basic mappings
" -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
" Press * to search for the term under the cursor or a visual selection and
" then press a key below to replace all instances of it in the current file.
nnoremap <Leader>r :%s///g<Left><Left>
nnoremap <Leader>rc :%s///gc<Left><Left><Left>

" The same as above but instead of acting on the whole file it will be
" restricted to the previously visually selected range. You can do that by
" pressing *, visually selecting the range you want it to apply to and then
" press a key below to replace all instances of it in the current selection.
xnoremap <Leader>r :s///g<Left><Left>
xnoremap <Leader>rc :s///gc<Left><Left><Left>
```

1. Put cursor over word you want to change
2. `shift` + `8`
3. Type word you want to replace and all matching words
  * **note** You could add `gc` at end an it will ask you to confirm each change (optional)
  * Use the `leader` + r + c to get that output
4. Press enter
5. All words from that point on will be replaced with your new word
6. Type `u` to undo changes

**note** If you don't see a word like this `%s//foobar/g` that means vim will replace your new world with the highlighted word

* You can also visually select a phrase and use `*` to select another match and keep pressing `n` to get more matches then just use `leader` + `r` to replace all the phrases with the new one you type * you need to add vim-visual-search plugin

The second keybinding is if you just want to change a word in a visual selection of text
1. move to the word
2. Type `*`
3. Visual mode and select chunk of code
4. leader + r and
5. enter
6. All the matching words in that section will change

## Multi-cursor (kindof but better)
* add a key binding in vimrc
* hover over word
* type `s` + `*`
* type replacement word
* hit escape
* press `.` to replace each word (you could hit `n` and go one by one and then hit . if you want to replace it)

## Swap Files
* `.swp` files are for backing up and you really shouldn't turn the backup system off

### A better solution is to add this in your `vimrc`
`.vimrc`

```
" create backups
set backup
" tell vim where to put its backup files
set backupdir=/tmp
```

* After adding that to your `vimrc` file, make sure to refresh your source 

`$ source ~/.zshrc`

* If you have a lot of files ending with `~` you can delete them with:

`$ find . -name '*~' -exec rm {} \;`

## To Clean out ALL vim Swap Files in a Directory
* If you are sure you don’t need any vim swap files in a directory tree and want to get rid of them, you can use the following command in the directory while vim is not running (not even in another window or even a different login session):
* This will delete all files whose names end with `.swk`, `.swl`, `.swm`, `.swn`, `.swo`, or `.swp` in the current directory tree

`$ find . -type f -name "*.sw[klmnop]" -delete`

## Visual Block Mode (DID NOT WORK)
1. `ctrl` + `v`
2. Select column
3. Move to right to highlight all words
4. `x` to cut them
5. `shift` + `i` to type new word
6. `esc` and all words will be updated at same time

## Open html file in Chrome browser (file:///)
`:!open % -a Google\ Chrome`

## Find each occurrence of `foo` (in all lines aka "globally"), and replace it with `bar`

`:%s/foo/bar/g`

## Replace all spaces with underscore
`:%s/ /_/g`

* Example: `One Two Three` gets transformed into `One_Two_Three`
* **note**: You need to add a `\` in front of the period – 

`:%s/\./ /g`

* This is because **regular expressions** use `.` as an "any character" wildcard

## Keyboard Shortcuts
### Closing tabs and windows
| Keyboard Shortcut      |    Action |
| :-------- | --------:|
| `:qa`  | Closes all tabs and vim |
| `:wqa`  | Closes all tabs and saves and vim |
| `:tabo` | Closes all tabs but current tab |
| `:on` | Closes all windows except current |

## Paste inline into tag
* Go to beginning of line `^`
* `D` to delete until end (inline)
* Place cursor `<h3></h3>` (over open p tag's closing chevron)
  - changes this:

```
<h3></h3{numeral(amount / 100).format('$0,0.00')}
```

* into this:

`<h3>{numeral(amount / 100).format('$0,0.00')}</h3>`

## Toggle Uppercase/Lowercase
* Switch to visual mode
* U uppercase
* u lowercase

  * example: `/people`
2. Press enter (that will highlight all words that match search)
3. Type `cgn` and type new word
4. Enter into **Normal** mode
5. Type `n` to get to next word match
6. Type `.` to repeat (keep typing to keep repeating changes)

:help NERDTreeMappings

If windows are open you can maximize current and minimize all others with
```
(Ctrl-Wo means holding Ctrl press W, and then o)
```

A better way: `:tab sp` splits current window into new tab
* to close current window and return to splits `ctrl` + `w` and press `c`

`t:` Open the selected file in a new tab
`i:` Open the selected file in a horizontal split window
`s:` Open the selected file in a vertical split window
`I:` Toggle hidden files
`m:` Show the NERD Tree menu
`R:` Refresh the tree, useful if files change outside of Vim
`?:` Toggle NERD Tree's quick help

### Directories

* You created a file/folder and Nerdtree isn't showing it to you
* You need to refresh Nerdtree
    - `r` ---> refresh current directory
    - R ----> refresh root directory's listing

### Adding files using Nerdtree
1. `m` ---> toggles menu open/closed
2. `a` ---> to add a file

* No `/` ----> it's a file

| `<c-x>` | split horizontal |
| `<c-t>` | new tab |

## CtrlP
`Plugin 'kien/ctrlp.vim' "Fuzzy searching if dmenu isn't available`

* Refresh it's cache
* Many times you'll be searching for a file you know exists (because you just created it) but it's not there
  - The reason is CtrlP uses a cache to keep things quick
  - Clear the cache by clicking the `F5` key after hitting the CtrlP keyboard trigger of `ctrl` + `p`
  - **note** If on Mac you need to check the `Use F1, F2, etc. keys as standard function keys` inside `Apple > System Preferences > Keyboard`

![f keys as standard function keys](https://i.imgur.com/QHLj3ZS.png)

```

## [My current `.vimrc` file](https://gist.github.com/kingluddite/c32c77724c4705bd05fa17080cfed95e)

## VimAwesome
* Site that lists all plugins and how to install them

1. Search for a plugin
2. Add the plugin to `~/.vimrc`
3. Run to refresh and load plugin(s)

```
:source %
:PluginInstall
```

## Refresh vim
* Think of this as the equivalent to refreshing our bash/zsh shells
* The old fashioned way is to close and reopen but that is too slow
* The faster way is `:e` or force refresh with `:e!`

## HTML comments
* Add a beginning and closing commet
* Type this in Text 
* `product-list|c`

```html
<!-- .product-list -->
<div class="product-list">Sameple</div>
<!-- /.product-list -->
```

## Indenting
* `Vjj` ---> Deselects automatically
* `gu` ---> reselects or `.` (period) to redo last task
* **note** Added `.vimrc` way to use **shift** to keep selection selected

## Vim Surround
* Useful plugin for easily surrounding tags or text with what you want
* Let's says I want to surround a word with `<strong>` tags

`csw<strong>` will turn `word` into `<strong>word</strong>`

* surround word with {}
  - `ysiw}` makes hello become `{hello}`
  - `ds"` makes `"hello"` be `hello`

Add this plugin to `.vimrc`

`Plugin 'tpope/vim-surround'`

description
Surround.vim is all about "surroundings": parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML tags, and more.  The plugin provides mappings to easily delete, change and add such surroundings in pairs.  While it works under Vim 6, much of the functionality requires Vim 7.

Examples follow.  It is difficult to provide good examples in the variable width font of this site; check the documentation for more.

Press cs"' (that's c, s, double quote, single quote) inside

"Hello world!"

to change it to

'Hello world!'

Now press cs'<q> to change it to

<q>Hello world!</q>

To go full circle, press cst" to get

"Hello world!"

To remove the delimiters entirely, press ds" .

Hello world!

Now with the cursor on "Hello", press ysiw] (iw is a text object).

[Hello] world!

Let's make that braces and add some space (use "}" instead of "{" for no space): cs]{

{ Hello } world!

Now wrap the entire line in parentheses with yssb or yss) .

({ Hello } world!)

Revert to the original text: ds{ds)

Hello world!

Emphasize hello: ysiw<em>

<em>Hello</em> world!

Finally, let's try out visual mode. Press a capital V (for linewise visual mode)
followed by S<p>.

"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js",
  "dev": "nodemon app.js"
}

<p>
  Hello world!
</p>

This plugin is very powerful for HTML and XML editing, a niche which currently seems underfilled in Vim land.  (As opposed to HTML/XML *inserting*, for which many plugins are available).  Adding, changing, and removing pairs of tags simultaneously is a breeze.

The "." command will work with ds, cs, and yss if you install repeat.vim, vimscript #2136.

## Sublime had a cool feature to highlight a word and change all words with that spelling. How can I do that in Vim?
* I love multi-cursor in Sublime Text
* There is a plugin in Vim to mimic this behavior but it is buggy and vim default functionality is better and far more powerful

## Copy function
* `va{Vy`
  - Say you are inside a function and you want to quickly copy the function so you can paste it somewhere else
  - `v` Switches to visual mode
  - `a` means "around"
  - `{` we search for the surrounding curly braces `{}`
  - `V` Select all lines of function
  - `y` Yanks all lines and puts them into machine clipboard
* **note** If you are nested deep, just keep typing `a{` until you have entire function

## Jump to matching object
* You are on the opening tag and want to jump to the closing tag
* Just type `%` and presto! Your at the closing tag

## Replace all words in file
* `%s/foo/bar/g`
  - Replace all `foo` words with `bar` globally

## Bubble text
* Sublime Text and Atom had a cool bubble text feature
* Just use `ctrl` + `cmd` key and **up/down** arrows will bubble your current line/lines up and down respectively
* How can we replicate this in Vim?
    - I added this inside `.vimrc` and now when I type `ctrl` + `k` will bubble line up and `ctrl` + `j` will bubble line down

`~/.vimrc`

```
" Bubble single lines
nmap <c-k> ddkP
nmap <c-j> ddp

" Bubble multiple lines
vmap <c-k> xkP`[V`]
vmap <c-j> xp`[V`]
```

`.vimrc`

```
" Code fold bliss
set foldmethod=indent

" Toggle fold at current position
nnoremap <s-tab> za
```

## Undo
* `U`

## Redo
* `Ctrl` + `r`

## Window Mgt
* `:vsp` ---> creates horizontal windows
* `:sp` ---> vertical windows
* Close window with `:q`
* And I added this to `.vimrc` to quickly switch to left and right windows
    - Unfortunately, the up and down down work because `ctrl` + `up` I use to switch to my mac control panel (use to move apps to different desktops)

```
" easy navigation in split windows
nnoremap <C-L> <C-W><C-L> " focus on left
nnoremap <C-H> <C-W><C-H> " focus on right
```

## Save
* Most people are using to `cmd` + `s` but the command key is wack in Vim on Macs
* I recommend using zz instead
* Add this to `.vimrc`

```
" save with zz
nnoremap zz :update<cr>
```

## I hate the escape key
* Switching to Normal mode using the escape key is a fast way to get carpal tunnel
* A better way is to use this keymap to make the key combination of `j` + `k` to switch you to normal mode

`.vimrc`

```
" map jk to esc
:imap jk <Esc>
```

* I also recommend changing caps lock to your escape key
    - [Read more on how to do this here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/127591/using-caps-lock-as-esc-in-mac-os-x)

## Bookmarks
* normal mode `ma` (local)
  - `mA` (global)
      + Global you can jump to files inside a project
      + Local is per file
* `'a` jumps to line (apostrophe)
* "```a```" (backtic + `a`)
  - Jumps to exact cursor position
* `d'a` ---> delete the 'a' bookmark
    - You an then move and paste it elsewhere with `p`
    - Or "delete line til mark"
    - `d`a` ---> delete from cursor of mark
* `y'a` copy line til mark
* `y` + `backtic` ---> copy cursor until
* `:marks` ----> list all bookmarks

## Movement
* `gg` ---> top of page
* `G` ----> bottom of page
* `21G` ----> move to line 21

## Leader key
* Usually changed to `;`
* I changed it to `,`

`.vimrc`

```
" TODO: Pick a leader key
" let mapleader = ","
```

## Add prettier
* Great for JavaScript

`Plugin 'prettier/prettier'`

## Vim Comment
* `gc` ---> comment out (visual mode too)
* `gcgc` ---> uncomment
* `gcap` --- comment out program

## Easy Motion
* Quick way to navigate

`.vimrc`

`Plugin 'easymotion/vim-easymotion'`

* With leader key changed to `,` (comma)
* `,,w`

## Broken Stuff
## HTML comments (todo: fix)
(Emmet - broken (tab doesn't work because of conflict ultisnip tab))
* I like to add closing comments when I type an HTML block tag
* `.product-list|c`
  - That will add a closing comment

## Vim can be slow so here's how you speed it up
  * (cursorline, cursorcolumn, vim-powerline, vim-airline, matchit.vim, etc.) slow down Vim in the terminal most significantly
  * Here are some lines from my `.vimrc` to keep things speedy:

  ```
  let loaded_matchparen=1 " Don't load matchit.vim (paren/bracket matching)
  set noshowmatch         " Don't match parentheses/brackets
  set nocursorline        " Don't paint cursor line
  set nocursorcolumn      " Don't paint cursor column
  set lazyredraw          " Wait to redraw
  set scrolljump=8        " Scroll 8 lines at a time at bottom/top
  let html_no_rendering=1 " Don't render italic, bold, links in HTML
  Also see :help slow-terminal
  ```

  * add this to Profile in iTerm settings changing from login shell to command 

  `/usr/local/bin/zsh -il` 

  * In iTerm's Preferences > Profiles > General > Command

## Remove next character multiple lines
```
  d/}/e
  does the job.

  d/} deletes until the } but adding the /e flag moves the cursor on the last char of the match, effectively deleting everything between the cursor and the }, inclusive.

  Using visual selection works too, in a slightly more intuitive way:

  v/}<CR>d
```
