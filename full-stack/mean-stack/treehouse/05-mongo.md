# MongoDB
## Mongo Shell Commands 
* [docs for mongodb shell commands](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongo-shell/)

## Do I need to start mongo?
* Some machines may have the MongoDB server running by default, and some may not (it it is running it is running as a `Service`)

### How can I check if mongo is running?
* To check, run `$ mongod` from your command line
    - If a process starts running without bringing you back to the command-line prompt, that means you have to manually `start` and `stop` MongoDB every time you use it, and you must open a new command-line window or tab if you need to use other commands
    - If your machine kicks you back to the command prompt after entering mongod, it's likely running by default and you don't need to do anything!

## 1. Installing MongoDB on Windows
1. Go to the MongoDB download page: <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community" target="_blank">MongoDB Download Center</a>
2. Scroll down, go to the green box with the Community Server Tab highlighted.
3. Go to the dropdown menu labeled "Version." Select "Windows 64-bit x64," then click the "DOWNLOAD (msi)" button.
4. The next page will thank you for downloading MongoDB then show a newsletter link. You can ignore this. In a few seconds, your browser will notify you that the file is downloading.
5. Open up Windows Explorer and locate the installation file (it should be in the default directory where your browser stores downloads). Open the file and follow the instructions.
* When the installer prompts you to "Choose Setup Type," click the Complete button, then carry on.
* **DO NOT** Install `Compass` along with your MongoDB install.
* A window might pop up mid-installation, asking you whether you’re sure you want to download a particular component of MongoDB. Click yes, otherwise the install will fail.

## 2. Configuring MongoDB on Windows
1. **IMPORTANT**: You need to create a data directory for your MongoDB installation, or it won't run. Open Git Bash, then cd your way to the root directory:
2. `cd c:`
3. Run the following command:
4. `mkdir -p data/db`
5. This is the default location for MongoDB’s databases. You need a directory for your databases, or else you MongoDB will refuse to run.
6. You’ll also want to add MongoDB’s path to the PATH environment variable, so that you can run it easily from the bash command line.
7. First, locate the directory where you installed MongoDB. This is likely `C:\\Program Files\\MongoDB\\Server\\<version_number>\\bin`. Copy this directory to your clipboard.
8. Then, open up the System menu or Control Card on your machine, usually accessible via the Start menu or Search Bar in Windows operating systems.
9. Go to Advanced Settings.
* If you are on Windows 10 and opened the Control Panel, click **System and Security**; **System**; and **Advanced System Settings**.
10. When a new window opens up, click the **Environment Variables** button located toward the bottom of the window.
11. An Environment Variables window should open up. Look at the bottom half of this window, a scrollable table called "System Variables." Look at the Variable column and search for the variable called Path. Click on it, then click the "Edit…" button below.
12. The next window will look different depending on your version of Windows. You’ll either be able to press the "New" button and paste your MongoDB directory into the input box that shows up, or you’ll have to paste the directory at the end of a long string of other directories. So it goes.
13. If you would prefer video instructions for this part, watch this:
    [![Youtube Link](http://img.youtube.com/vi/sBdaRlgb4N8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBdaRlgb4N8&feature=youtu.be&t=120)
14. Test if it worked: Close your current Git Bash window, then reopen it and run this command: `mongod`
15. **NOTE**: No "b" at the end, simply `mongod`
16. If mongod is still running, great job! Now go ahead and open a new instace of Git Bash, and enter the command: `mongo`. This will initialize the Mongo Shell and allow you to begin entering commands via the Mongo Shell. Congratulations, you’ve installed MongoDB. Your instructor will take it from here.
17. If mongod didn’t run, and instead your bash threw a "command not found" error, make sure you added MongoDB’s bin directory to your PATH variable (see step B.3). Then, close out git bash and try running mongod again.
18. If mongod starts but closes after a series of prompts, make sure you created the data/db directory in your root. MongoDB cannot run without this directory (see steps 2.1-2.2).
19. If you’re still encountering issues starting mongod, please ask for assistance from one of the TAs or the instructor.

## 3. Installing MongoDB on MacOS
1. Run the following command in terminal:
2. `brew install mongodb`
- - -
## 4. Configuring MongoDB on MacOS
1. **IMPORTANT**: You need to create a data directory for your MongoDB installation, or it will not work. 
2. Use the following exact commands (see note below if you want to know what these do):
   1. `sudo mkdir -p /data/db`
   2. `sudo chown -R $USER /data/db`
   3. `sudo chmod go+w /data/db`
3. With the data/db directory made, you're ready to run MongoDB. Enter this command in your terminal window: `mongod`
4. **NOTE**: No "b" at the end, simply `mongod`
5. If mongod didn’t exit from your window, great job! You’ve installed MongoDB. Your instructor will take it from here.
6. If mongod starts but closes after a series of prompts, make sure you created the data/db directory in your root directory, MongoDB cannot run without this directory (see steps 4.1-4.2).
7. If you’re still encountering issues starting mongod, please ask for assistance from one of the TAs or the instructor.
8. If you do not want to use homebrew, you can alternatively follow these instructions: <https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.0/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/>. However, installing MongoDB without homebrew can be a bit of a headache. Installing homebrew on your mac will make your life as a web developer a ton easier.
_The commands in #2 create a directory with administrative privileges, make your account the owner of that directory (instead of the "root" account owning it), and add write permissions to that directory so the apps you write are able to update your database_


Going from mock data to real data.

## Mongoose
We will use Mongoose
* node middleware
* Lets us create complex Objects (aka **models**)
    - To represent our data and store it in **MongoDB**

## Install MongoDB
* Use brew (look at my MongoDB notes)

## Multiple Terminal Tabs!
Lets open multiple Terminal tabs

### In Terminal tab #1
Start mongodaemon

```
$ mongod
```

### In Terminal tab #2
Then start our Express app

```
$ nodemon
```

### In Terminal tab #3
Install Mongoose

```
$ npm install --save -E mongoose
```

* We save it to our package.json file
* We add `-E` to save exact version

## Create a database.js file

```
$ touch src/database.js
```

```js
'use strict';

var mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );

mongoose.connect( 'mongodb://localhost/mean-todo' );
```

## Require the database 

**src/app.js**

```js
'use strict';

// need to import express to use it
var express = require( 'express' );

var router = require( './api' );

// need to create an instance of express server
// allows us to set up any middle ware we may need
// to configure routes and start the server
var app = express();

// HERE IS WHERE WE REQUIRE THE DATABASE!!!!
require( './database' ); // ADD THIS LINE

// tell express to server static files from public folder
app.use( '/', express.static( 'public' ) );

app.use( '/api', router );

app.listen( 3000, function() {
  console.log( 'Server is listening on port 3000' );
} );
```

## Mongoose is a singleton
Means when you do something with Mongoose in one file, those changes happen with files across your node process

* We are not doing anything with the **./database** file
* We are just making sure it is required and run

### The Terminal is not telling us about MongoDB yet

**database.js**

```js
'use strict';

var mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );

mongoose.connect( 'mongodb://localhost/mean-todo', function( err ) {
  if ( err ) {
    console.log( 'Failed connecting to MongoDB!' );
  } else {
    console.log( 'You have connected to Mongo! Mongoliciousness has begun!' );
  }
} );
```

![mongo is running](https://i.imgur.com/aZLu56p.png)

## Create a Schema
A way to define and control an object that will be stored in the database

### Create `models` directory

**src/models/todo.js**

```js
'use strict';

var mongoose = require( 'mongoose' );

// todo.name
// todo.completed

var todoSchema = new mongoose.Schema( {
  name: String,
  completed: Boolean
} );

var model = mongoose.model( 'Todo', todoSchema );

module.exports = model;
```

[Documenation on Mongoose Schema types](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html)

Says what data types are required for our fields.

Because Mongoose is a **Singleton**, the `Todo` model is registered with Mongoose wherever you require Mongoose

### Best Practice
But it is a best practice to export the model itself
* _(in case you are using more advanced configurations)_

## Debugging Refresher
Tools to help us debug our application

### Iron Node
Essential tool for developing node applications
* Lets us interact with a debugged applications in the browser while the node application is running

#### Install iron-node globally
Remember that when we install something globally we can use it on any node application on our machine

```
$ npm install iron-node -g
```

## Breakpoints
When debugging an app, `breakpoints` are the core aspect of how you'll do it

### Two ways to set breakpoints in iron-node
1. Writing a perminent breakpoint into your application code

**src/app.js**

```js
'use strict';

debugger; // WE ADD THIS LINE

// need to import express to use it
var express = require( 'express' );

var router = require( './api' );

// need to create an instance of express server
// allows us to set up any middle ware we may need
// to configure routes and start the server
var app = express();

require( './database' );

// tell express to server static files from public folder
app.use( '/', express.static( 'public' ) );

app.use( '/api', router );

app.listen( 3000, function() {
  console.log( 'Server is listening on port 3000' );
} );
```

## Run iron-node

```
$ iron-node src/app.js
```

### iron-node issues
There's an [issue](https://github.com/s-a/iron-node/issues/104) with the latest version of iron-node 

Uninstall your current version and install a previous version using this command:

```
$ npm uninstall -g iron-node && npm install -g iron-node@2.2.17
```

Once you run iron-node you can start setting breakpoints

When you refresh your page, iron-node will stop on your `debugger` statement

## Set debugger statement in src/api/index.js
Do this in the iron-node console

![set breakpoint in iron-node](https://i.imgur.com/YiNzgzD.png)

* You can edit code directly inside `iron-node`
* Most developer do most of their debugging inside their editor
* After making changes in `iron-node` **console**, save the file
    - You hit first debugger statement
    - Hit `play`
    - Server will be running
    - Visit landing page `http://localhost:3000`
    - **GET request** will run
    - `Todos` will not show up
        + Because debugger stopped in the middle of your **GET request**

**note:** There are 2 versions of your file loaded into `iron-node`
* Virtual file loaded into memory
  - Allows you to interactively set breakpoints
    + They are called `temporary breakpoints`
    + You can set these breakpoints on any line
    + In the console you can check them on or off
    + Or use this key to turn all of them off or on

![turn all breakpoints off/on](https://i.imgur.com/uTeYtLh.png)

**note** File will be automatically loaded when a debugger statement is hit

### Manually load a file
* Just like in Sublime Text, `cmd` + `p` skuzzy search for your file **use path** to narrow down search.
* Some search results are the virtual file (look for `//Users`)
* The **Call Stack** lets you click on anything that's been run (Express backend)
* The magic of debugging is that at any time you are stopped at a breakpoint you can hover over a variable to see what that variable is assigned to

![hover over variables](https://i.imgur.com/xxIVKrU.png)

* You can look at Local Variables
* Closure variables
* Global variables

Final way to work with variables locally is through the **console**

`> todos`

`> res`

* For the response object

`> res.status(500)` 

You can even run functions

The console allows you to interactively explore your application
as if you were inside the JavaScript interpreter

## Stop iron-node
`ctrl` + `c`

**note** Most of the time you'll be using `nodemon` and you'll only use iron-node when you need to check on an internal process
