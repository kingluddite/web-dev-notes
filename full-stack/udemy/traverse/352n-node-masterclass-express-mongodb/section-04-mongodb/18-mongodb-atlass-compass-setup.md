# MongoDB, Atlas & Compass Setup
* MongoDB noSQL
    - noSQL Database's are fast and scalable
    - The structure
        + We use Collections
        + In those collections we have `Documents`
        + Each record is formatted like JSON data
            * Curly braces
            * Key/value pairs
            * You can have different data types in the JSON structure

## Mongo Atlas
* Is a cloud Database
* It is a version of MongoDB that runs in the cloud as opposed to running on your local machine
    - You could install it locally
        + But then you run into all the different OS' developers could be using
        + The cloud Database is easier to manage
            * We can use it in deployment in development and production
            * Create a production and developer remote Database
* We'll use Compass to connect to our remote Database (or local Database)
    - It is an GUI for working with our remote Database
        + Similar to pgAdmin, phpMyAdmin for MySQL
