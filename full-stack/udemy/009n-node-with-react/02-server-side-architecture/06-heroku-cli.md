# Installing the Heroku CLI
## Steps you repeat for any Node JS project you want to deploy on Heroku

## List of Steps for first time deployments
![steps for deploy](https://i.imgur.com/cnxb4gi.png)

1. Create Heroku Account - Easy and free
2. Create code base to git
    * Heroku uses a git based deployment
    * Create our code base to git
        - Sounds easy
        - But can be very confusing

### Git stuff
* Make sure you have Git installed on your machine `$ git --version`
* If not, install it from [download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Or install homebrew and install Git with homebrew - [watch video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUviVWnvBM8)
* `$ git init`
    - That will initialize an empty Git repo
    - Add code to staging `$ git add .`
    - If you created and setup `.gitignore` correctly, you should not see `node_modules`
        + If you do see `node_modules` - Time for you to troubleshoot
    - Commit code `$ git commit -m 'initialize repo'`

3. Install Heroku CLI - [Read the instructions](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
    * The purpose of this CLI is to generate a new Heroku project
    * I recommend installing it with homebrew `$ brew install heroku`
    * After installing check install was successful with `$ heroku -v`
        - If you see a version you are ready to proceed to next step
        - If not - time to troubleshoot

4. Create a new Heroku App
    * Log into your Heroku account via the terminal with: `$ heroku login`
    * Enter your heroku `email` and `password`
    * Create heroku app with `$ heroku create`
        - You will see two links
            + First link is URL to our live site
            + Second link is URL to heroku Git repo
                * The second link is one we really care about
                * It is our deployment target
                    - It is a Git repository that we can push our local server to
                * We already committed our entire code base to Git
                * We are now going to push that local repo to the remote repo that is managed by Heroku
                    - The minute we do this, Heroku will then deploy our entire application and start it up automatically

5. Deploy App with Git
    * We first need to set up a remote Git repo
        - We do this by copying the second link (remote Heroku Git repo)
        - Then typing `$ git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/mysterious-sierra-29112.git`
        - (Make sure to use your own remote Heroku link)
        - You may not see any feedback if it was successful
        - If you did this already you will see 'fatal: remote heroku already exists' which you can safely ignore
    * We deploy to heroku with `$ git push heroku master`
        - You will see feedback of deployment from Heroku in Terminal
        - It will build our application
        - It will [automatically detect we are using Node.js](https://i.imgur.com/fHminXS.png)
        - It will set some [runtime flags](https://i.imgur.com/j4Lnapj.png)
        - It will [detect our engines of node and npm](https://i.imgur.com/8eWXizu.png) that we specified in `package.json`
            + I accidentally put the wrong node version (I put `8.4.1` instead of `8.1.4`) and I got an error and it could not deploy
            + I changed the number to `8.1.4` and tried it again but it still errored on deployment and it still said the old number of `8.4.1` - This is an **important** point to remember, when you make changes, you need to add and commit them to your local Git repo before pushing to Heroku's remote repo, or Heroku won't see your changes!
        - It will [install all our dependencies](https://i.imgur.com/8mxT1Gp.png) inside `package.json`
        - At the end you should see `Build succeeded!`
            + If not, time to troubleshoot
        - At end you will see [verifying deploy... done](https://i.imgur.com/UMOeKHU.png) and shows you where it was deployed to (your remote Heroku Git repo)
    * Open our new application
        - `$ heroku open`
        - You should see it opens the browser and navigates to our deployed Project!

## Heroku Troubleshooting
* `$ heroku logs`
    - Heroku will now give you some output generated by the output process
    - Look for an error to find out what went wrong during the deployment

## List of Steps for Subsequent deployments
![subsequent deploy steps](https://i.imgur.com/yBPMTUQ.png)

1. Make a change to the code base
2. Make sure all files inside your editor are saved
    * `File` > `Save All` (Sublime Text 3) --> `opt` + `cmd` + `s`
3. Check Git status `$ git status`
    * You will see all the files you changed/added/deleted
4. Add files `$ git add -A`
5. Commit `$ git commit -m 'useful commit message here`
6. `$ git push heroku master`
    * It will give you the same feedback as before
    * If you have errors troubleshoot with `$ heroku logs`
    * If all works, congrats
    * Rinse and repeat for the life of your app
    * When you type `$ heroku open` you should see your new changes have been implemented
