# Containers & Reducers Review
* Redux serves to construct Application `state`
* React provides the views to display that `state`
* The two libraries are inherently disconnected
* It is ONLY through `react-redux` that we get a clear connection between the two

## Our Application `state` is generated by Reducer functions
* Here is our one and only reducer `src/reducers/reducerBooks.js`

```js
export default function() {
  return [
    { title: 'JavaScript: the Good Parts'},
    { title: 'JavaScript Ninja' },
    { title: 'Eloquent JavaScript'},
    { title: 'The Hobbit'},
  ]
}
```

* `reducerBooks` always returns an array of books no matter what
* It is always the same array
* The array contains a list of objects
    - Each object represents a book
    - Where each book has a title

## We added our booksReducer to the combineReducer inside of 

`src/reducers/index.js`

```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import BooksReducer from './ReducerBooks';

const rootReducer = combineReducers({
  books: BooksReducer
});

export default rootReducer;
```

* Our `state` is always going to be an object
    - With a a key of books
    - And a value of an array of books

## BookList
* Next we created a functional Component
* But then we decided it needed to be aware of our state within the Redux side of the Application
* Because `BookList` had to be aware of that `state` we decided to promote it to a `Container`

### How did we promote BookList to a Container
* First - importing the `connect()` function 'react-redux'
* Then we defined `mapStateToProps()`
* Then we hooked our Component together with `mapStateToProps` using the `connect()` function
* We chose `BookList` to be the Container because `App` doesn't need to know about the list of books at all

### Finally
* We made sure that `App` rendered `BookList`

`App.js`

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import BookList from '../containers/BookList';

export default class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <BookList />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

* Redux generated a `state` object that contained our books and then mapped that `state` as `props` to our Component
* Because the `state` was updated (_through our reducer_) our Component re-rendered with that list of books
* **note** A `Container` is a normal React Component that gets bonded to the Application `state` and we connect the two (we meld the two together)
* Whenever our Application `state` changes the `Container` will re-render as well

## Next Challenge
* Selecting a particular book
