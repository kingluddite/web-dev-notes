# What is Gatsby?
* A static site generator
    - But this really isn't a good definition
    - Gatsby is more closer to being a framework than just a simple static site generator

## Gatsby features
* Gatsby is build on top of React
* When we develop our project and we're ready to go live:
    - Gatsby will transform our project into a single directory with a single HTML file and static assets
    - Gatsby also use powerful preconfiguration
        + This gives us stuff like:
            * code-splitting
            * fast page loads
            * server side rendering
            * asset and image optimization
            * service workers
            * data pre-fetching
            * All of this and more is right out of the box
        + Also note that the static content gatsby generates can then be enhanced with client-side JavaScript via React hydration
            * This just means we get the best of both worlds
            * Our gatsby project can have app like features (like a traditional react app) but it is super fast and optimized
* `$ npm node -v` (version)
* free sites:
    - Contentful

* Plugin for VS Code
