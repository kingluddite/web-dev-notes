# Docs
* Sandbox - has a docs section
* Not much to it, as everything you need is in explorer
* If you click on our docs you'll have the Query
* Click on Query
    - Then you'll see all the fields

## Let's look at contentfulProduct as example
* You will see all arguments
* Click on it
    - You'll see arguments
    - But also subfields
        + This will give you the types (ie String, Float...)
        + If subfields has more fields it self, you click on it and you'll see the subfields of subfields

## In most cases you'll stick with explorer
