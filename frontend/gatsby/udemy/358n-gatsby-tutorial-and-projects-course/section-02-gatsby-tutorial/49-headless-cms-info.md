## What is Headless CMS?
* A concept of decoupling your data from your project

### Traditional CMS - WordPress
* The moment you want to use your data separately, you will face many challenges and hit numerous roadblocks
    - This is because it is meant to go hand in hand with your project

### Vs Headless CMS
* You take a few moments to set up your data
* Then you figure out how to consume that data in literally any frontend
    - In our case we'll use Gatsby
    - We could also just as easily used React/Svelt or even Vanilla JS

## Note about Open Source
* Does not mean it is completely free
