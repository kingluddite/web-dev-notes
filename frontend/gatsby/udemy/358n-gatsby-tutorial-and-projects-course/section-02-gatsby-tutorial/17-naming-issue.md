# Naming issue
* **tip** type 25 words `p>lorem25` + tab (emmet)
* Use classes to target p on 2 different pages with different styles

```
// MORE CODE

.blog-text {
  color: red;
  line-height: 0.5;
}

.products-text {
  color: red;
  line-height: 3;
}

// MORE CODE
```

* This works ok on a small project but a larger project means you have to come up with lots of names

## Next `css modules` makes this a lot easier to handle classes on a large project
