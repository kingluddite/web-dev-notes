# Local Data vs External Data
* Local
    - JSON
    - Markdown
    - MDX
        + Very cool option
        + Allows us to combine markdown and react
* External (Much easier to work with)
    - The setup for consuming the data and setting up pages programmatically is almost the same for both
        + And if you ever need to switch to local data you'll be able to do that in no time
    - Headless CMS
        + Contentful
        + Strapi
