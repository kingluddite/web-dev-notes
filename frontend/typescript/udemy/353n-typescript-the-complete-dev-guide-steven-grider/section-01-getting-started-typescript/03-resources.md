## What is TypeScript
* Typescript = JavaScript + `A Type system`
* Typescript is just JavaScript

### The TS Type System
* The TS Type System only in development (does not get compiled)
* Doesn't provide any performance optimization

## How we write TS
1. Write TS code (just JavaScript with type annotations)
2. Throw it into the TS Compiler
3. Converts to plain old JavaScript for the browser or Node.js and execute

* The browser executes plain JavaScript
* The browser has no idea we wrote TS

## Best way to think of TS
* It is a friend who is sitting behind you while you write code to help you catch errors
