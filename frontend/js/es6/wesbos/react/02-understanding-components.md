# Understanding Components
Everything in React is a Component

## What is a Component?
A reusable piece of your website

Think of Tags in HTML. React lets you build your own tags and you can put information inside these tags and those two things together is a Component

Use the Inspect Element in Chrome and then from there click the `React` tab and that will show you how React sees it and that is Components nested inside Components

**benefits of Components** Team members can just work on one Component 

## Parent Component
The main parent Component is the `App` Component

## What is State
All our Components will pull on the same data and any time that data changes all the Components that pull on it will update simultaneously
